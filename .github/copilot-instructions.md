## Project Overview
This is a Next.js 15 web game platform with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The project uses the app router structure with `page.tsx` files for each route.

## Key Technologies
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React hooks for state management
- Client-side games implementation

## Project Structure Guidelines
- Use the `src/app` directory structure for routing
- Each game should be in its own route under `/games/[game-name]`
- Games should be fully client-side React components
- Use TypeScript interfaces for game state and props
- Follow React best practices and hooks for state management

## Code Style
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript typing
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Keep games modular and easily extensible
- Use descriptive component and variable names

## Game Implementation
- All games should be client-side only
- Use React hooks for game state management
- Implement proper game logic with TypeScript
- Make games responsive and accessible
- Design for easy addition of new games in the future
